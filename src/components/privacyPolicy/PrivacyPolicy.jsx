            <h4>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

                We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated
                version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the
                updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
                If we make material changes to this privacy notice we may notify
                you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
                directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review
                this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are
