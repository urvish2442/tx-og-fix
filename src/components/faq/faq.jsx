                        <p>
                            An NFT is a digital asset that represents ownership
                            of a unique, verifiable, and scarce digital item,
                            such as art, collectibles, or virtual real estate.
                            NFTs are stored on a blockchain, ensuring their
                            authenticity and scarcity.
                        </p>

                question: "What is Gas?",

                        <p>
                            Gas is a crucial concept in the Ethereum blockchain,
                            representing the fees required to execute
                            transactions and run smart contracts. Gas fees are
                            denominated in “gwei,” the smallest unit of ether,
                            the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum. The gas fee
                            determines the likelihood of validators prioritizing
                            a transaction or smart contract execution. When
                            minting a work on TesseractX, you’ll be given a
                            prediction of the minting cost in dollars. If you’re
                            quoted an unusually high price, we recommend waiting
                            until the gas price normalizes.
