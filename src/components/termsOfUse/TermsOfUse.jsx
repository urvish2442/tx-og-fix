        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
            <li>
                <strong>Uploading Digital Assets:</strong> Users can start the
                minting process by uploading their digital assets in supported
                formats. TesseractX supports a wide range of file types to
                accommodate various forms of digital art and collectibles:
                <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
                    <li>Images: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP</li>
                    <li>
                        360 Images: PNG, JPG with specific Exif XMP tag

                        3D Files: GLB (maximum file size: 150MB for the main
                        asset, 35MB for cover images)

            <li>
                <strong>Metadata Fields:</strong> After uploading the digital
                asset users must fill in the required metadata fields which
                include the title, description, and other relevant information
                about the NFT. Accurate and detailed metadata helps in the
                proper categorization and discovery of the NFT.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Setting Prices and Royalties:</strong> During the
                minting process users have the option to set the initial sale
                price of the NFT as well as a royalty rate. The royalty rate
                determines the percentage of each subsequent sale that will be
                paid to the original creator. This feature ensures that artists
                continue to benefit from the resale of their work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Batch Minting:</strong> For users looking to mint
                multiple NFTs at once, TesseractX offers a batch minting
                feature. This allows artists to upload and mint several digital
                assets simultaneously, streamlining the process and saving time.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>BUYING NFTS</h4>

            Purchasing NFTs on TesseractX is designed to be straightforward and
            secure allowing collectors to easily acquire unique digital assets:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
            <li>
                <strong>Supported Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Users can buy NFTs
                using various cryptocurrencies with Ether (ETH) being the
                primary supported token. Other supported tokens may be available
                depending on platform updates and integrations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transaction Confirmation:</strong> All transactions are
                processed through the user’s connected blockchain wallet. Once a
                purchase is initiated the user must confirm the transaction
                within their wallet to complete the sale. This ensures that the
                process is secure and that the ownership of the NFT is
                accurately recorded on the blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Finality of Sales:</strong> It is important to note that
                all sales on TesseractX are final. Due to the immutable nature
                of blockchain transactions once a sale is confirmed it cannot be
                reversed. Users should ensure they review all details and are
                certain of their purchase before confirming the transaction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>FEES AND TAXES</h4>
        <p>
            Understanding the costs associated with using TesseractX is crucial
            for both artists and buyers. Here is a breakdown of the fees and tax
            considerations:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
            <li>
                <strong>Minting Fees:</strong> The cost of minting an NFT on
                TesseractX can vary based on the current gas prices on the
                Ethereum network. Gas fees are dynamic and fluctuate depending
                on network congestion and other factors. TesseractX provides an
                estimated cost in dollars at the time of minting to help users
                anticipate the expense.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Transaction Fees:</strong> When an NFT is bought or sold
                on the platform TesseractX charges a transaction fee which is a
                percentage of the sale price. This fee helps support the
                maintenance and development of the platform.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Tax Compliance:</strong> Users are responsible for
                understanding and complying with their local tax regulations
                regarding NFT transactions. This may include reporting income
                from sales paying applicable taxes on purchases and any other
                legal obligations related to digital assets. Consulting with a
                tax professional is recommended to ensure full compliance with
                local laws.
            </li>
        </ul>
